# SmartPricing-A-Deep-Learning-Based-Dynamic-Pricing-System-for-E-commerce-Entrepreneurs
Abstract—This research paper is focusing on building a
deep learning based dynamic pricing model for e-commerce
entrepreneurs. This model will help the entrepreneurs to get
an idea about the textile industry and helps them to understand
the value of their products in the market. The main focus of
the project is to create a deep learning model which is able
to predict a textile product price based on various features
such as brand, category, and product attributes of other similar
products, from the given dataset. The model utilizes a multilayered neural network architecture with batch normalization
and dropout regularization to prevent over fitting. The dataset is
preprocessed using a combination of numerical and categorical
feature transformations. The model is trained using the Adam
optimizer with early stopping, and learning rate scheduling to
optimize performance. The project is also aiming to find out the
methods to make a good deep learning model for dynamic price
prediction for fashion dataset. This is a simple and powerful
model which is helpful for entrepreneurs, while all other models
are focusing on customer’s satisfaction.

I. OBJECTIVE
The main objectives of this research paper are:
1) To develop a deep learning-based dynamic pricing model
for e-commerce entrepreneurs in the textile industry,
which helps them to sell their product with a maximum
profit.
2) To build the model which is capable of accurately
predicting product prices based on various features such
as brand, category, and product attributes of other similar
products.
3) To find out effective methods for creating a robust deep
learning model for dynamic price prediction in fashion
datasets.
